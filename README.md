# Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation

Welcome to the **Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation** repository! This repository contains materials and code for two key AI topics that will elevate your understanding and skills in the field of computer vision:

1. **Image Classification**
2. **Image Segmentation**

### ðŸŽ“ Instructor: Teerapong Panboonyuen, Ph.D.

Hello, I'm **Teerapong Panboonyuen**, and I'll be guiding you through the exciting world of image analysis using cutting-edge AI techniques. With hands-on lectures, you will learn the fundamentals and practical aspects of modern image classification and segmentation algorithms.

### ðŸ“š **Main Resources**

- **Slides on Basic AI to OCSB**: [View the slides](https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI/blob/main/slides/20250317_BasicAI_toOCSB.pdf)
  
- **Lab: Titanic Machine Learning**: N/A

- **Lab: Satellite Classification**: N/A

- **Lab: Image Segmentation**: N/A

---

### ðŸ§  What You Will Learn:
- **Image Classification**: You will understand how AI models, particularly deep neural networks, are trained to recognize and classify images into various categories.
- **Image Segmentation**: You'll explore how AI models can be trained to segment images into meaningful regions or objects, making them highly useful for tasks such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more.

Both topics will be taught using popular frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**, making it easy for you to implement and experiment with your own models.

### ðŸ“¥ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI.git
cd OCSB-AI
```

Then, install the required libraries and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch (depending on the model you choose to run)
- Other standard dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### ðŸš€ How to Run

#### 1. **Titanic Classification:**
Run the Titanic Machine Learning notebook to train an AI model using the Titanic dataset. You can experiment with different models such as RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and Neural Networks using `sklearn`.

- Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
  [Titanic Machine Learning Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI/code/Titanic_ML.ipynb)

#### 2. **Satellite Classification:**
Run the Satellite Classification notebook to work on image classification tasks using AI models such as CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet. You will use pretrained models for classification tasks.

- Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
  [Satellite Classification Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI/code/Satellite_Classification.ipynb)

#### 3. **Image Segmentation:**
Run the Image Segmentation notebook to perform pixel-level segmentation on satellite images. This notebook includes both deep learning-based segmentation and evaluation techniques.

- Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
  [Image Segmentation Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI/code/Titanic_ML.ipynb) (Note: You might want to update this link with the correct one for segmentation if it's different from the Titanic ML)
