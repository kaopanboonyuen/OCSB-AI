# Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation

Welcome to the **Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation** repository! This repository contains materials and code for two key AI topics that will elevate your understanding and skills in the field of computer vision:

1. **Image Classification**
2. **Image Segmentation**

### ðŸŽ“ Instructor: Teerapong Panboonyuen, Ph.D.

Hello, I'm **Teerapong Panboonyuen**, and I'll be guiding you through the exciting world of image analysis using cutting-edge AI techniques. With hands-on lectures, you will learn the fundamentals and practical aspects of modern image classification and segmentation algorithms. 

---

### ðŸ§  What You Will Learn:
- **Image Classification**: You will understand how AI models, particularly deep neural networks, are trained to recognize and classify images into various categories.
- **Image Segmentation**: You'll explore how AI models can be trained to segment images into meaningful regions or objects, making them highly useful for tasks such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more.

Both topics will be taught using popular frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**, making it easy for you to implement and experiment with your own models.

### ðŸ“¥ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/OCSB-AI.git
cd OCSB-AI
```

Then, install the required libraries and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ”§ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch (depending on the model you choose to run)
- Other standard dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### ðŸš€ How to Run

#### 1. **Image Classification:**
Run the `image_classification.py` script to train an AI model that classifies images into predefined categories. You can use your own dataset or experiment with popular datasets like **CIFAR-10** or **MNIST**.

```bash
python image_classification.py
```

#### 2. **Image Segmentation:**
Run the `image_segmentation.py` script to train a model that performs pixel-level segmentation, categorizing each pixel into meaningful segments (such as objects or regions in an image).

```bash
python image_segmentation.py
```
