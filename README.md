# Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation

Welcome to the **Modern AI for Image Classification and Segmentation** repository! This repository contains materials and code for two key AI topics that will elevate your understanding and skills in the field of computer vision:

1. **Image Classification**
2. **Image Segmentation**

### ðŸŽ“ Instructor: Teerapong Panboonyuen, Ph.D.

Hello, I'm **Teerapong Panboonyuen**, and I'll be guiding you through the exciting world of image analysis using cutting-edge AI techniques. With hands-on lectures, you will learn the fundamentals and practical aspects of modern image classification and segmentation algorithms.

### ðŸ§  What You Will Learn:
- **Image Classification**: You will understand how AI models, particularly deep neural networks, are trained to recognize and classify images into various categories.
- **Image Segmentation**: You'll explore how AI models can be trained to segment images into meaningful regions or objects, making them highly useful for tasks such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and more.

Both topics will be taught using popular frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**, making it easy for you to implement and experiment with your own models.
